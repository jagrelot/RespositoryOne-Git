5. Set the build file to: thorax/build.xml
6. Set the following properties
    * script=
        + full_backup.main - rebuilds full package of org and retrieves
        + soft_backup.main - uses existing package from branch and retrieves
        + Additional targets may be called from std/build.xml
        + To call more targets, add a folder with a build.xml file inside of scripts/
            - The format for calling is projectname.targetname
            - Scripts may reference each other in this way (see full_backup.main)
    * sf.username=Your Salesforce username
    * sf.password=Your Salesforce password
    * sf.serverurl=The URL you would like to deploy to
        + https://test.salesforce.com for sandboxes
        + https://login.salesforce.com for production
        + Custom URLs can also be used

###Limitations:
1. Salesforce Metadata API limits retrievals to 10,000 components
    * A workaround is possible, but has not yet been developed
